# AR-Application 
 This repository provides the source code and related files for a simple Augmented Reality (AR) application developed using Unreal Engine 5.1.1 and Google ARCore. The app allows users to place a virtual coffee mug on real-world surfaces detected by the device camera and scale it to their desired size.

This short video shows the overall project when it is run on an Android device. :)
